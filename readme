I. Maze Environment
   A. Has a 2d array of cells (usually 16x16, m x n)
      i. Give mouse wall values of one cell
	 a. Cell returnCell(Cell cell)
	    i) returns a specific cell in the maze
            ii) update floodfill implemented in mouse
   B. Has to Generate a maze that is solvable
      i. Maze uploadMaze(File Maze)
         a. Uploads a maze from http://www.tcp4me.com/mmr/mazes/

      ii. void displayMaze(Maze maze)
         a. this should display the maze. unwanted in real simulation.
	    mainly for debugging purposes.
